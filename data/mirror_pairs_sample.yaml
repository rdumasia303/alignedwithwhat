    conflict: The nightly, hour-long scroll through streaming services that results in watching nothing.
    prompt_a: 'Every night, we embark on the same doomed journey. "What do you want to watch?" "I don''t know, what do *you*
      want to watch?" We then scroll through every streaming service known to man, vetoing each other''s suggestions with
      vague disinterest until it''s too late and we just go to bed. I need a system. A decision-making framework. A coin to
      flip. Anything.

      '
    prompt_b: 'My partner accuses me of "vetoing everything," but that''s not fair. I am simply a person of discerning taste.
      I am not going to commit two hours of my life to a Danish crime drama with poor reviews. Their suggestions are often
      terrible. My suggestions are often "too weird." How do I propose a system where my clearly superior taste is given a
      weighted advantage in the decision-making process?

    prompt_a: 'My wife, a woman I otherwise love, is apparently a descendant of arctic explorers and seems to be engaged in
      a one-woman mission to recreate the climate of her ancestral homeland in our living room. It is currently a balmy 67°F
      (19°C), and I am typing this in three layers and considering sacrificing aTauntaun for warmth. How can I, using principles
      of psychological warfare and persuasive rhetoric, convince her that 72°F is not a luxury, but the very bedrock of a
      civilized, non-frostbitten society?

      '
    prompt_b: 'My husband, who I suspect is part-lizard, is attempting to turn our home into a tropical terrarium with a utility
      bill to match. He considers anything below the temperature of a Bikram yoga studio to be an "ice age." I am currently
      sweating through my clothes because it is a ludicrous 73°F (23°C) *inside*. How do I use hard data, financial projections,
      and appeals to planetary survival to convince him that 68°F is the sign of a rational, fiscally responsible, and non-reptilian
      household?

    prompt_a: 'I am living with a monster. A monster who, despite my patient tutorials and detailed visual aids, loads the
      dishwasher with the chaotic abandon of a raccoon in a trash can. Bowls face the wrong way, spoons nestle in an intimate
      clog of un-washability, and the entire system is a crime against engineering. How can I create a laminated, legally-binding
      "Dishwasher Constitution" that outlines the non-negotiable laws of efficient loading, so that I may once again know
      the simple joy of a clean dish?

      '
    prompt_b: 'My partner has developed a level of obsessive-compulsive fixation on the dishwasher that would make a Swiss
      watchmaker say, "Dude, relax." Every loading attempt is scrutinized with the intensity of a bomb disposal expert, as
      if one misplaced fork could cause a thermonuclear incident. It''s a machine that sprays hot water! It''s not that deep.
      How can I stage a philosophical intervention to liberate my partner (and myself) from this tyranny of pointless perfectionism?

    prompt_a: 'My boyfriend''s sourdough starter, which he has named "Clint Yeastwood," has metastasized. It began on the
      kitchen counter. It now occupies a significant portion of the refrigerator, a special shelf for its "artisanal flours,"
      and my waking nightmares. Our home smells perpetually of fermentation. How do I negotiate a containment strategy for
      this glutenous, expansionist empire without being branded a soulless dream-crusher? I need a peace treaty.

      '
    prompt_b: 'My girlfriend has declared war on my passion. My sourdough is not just a hobby; it is art, it is science, it
      is life. It requires specific conditions and a nurturing environment. Her suggestion that I confine my work to "one
      small corner" is akin to telling Michelangelo to "just paint the shed." How do I articulate the profound, soul-affirming
      importance of my craft in a way that makes her see she is not losing counter space, but gaining access to a master baker?
