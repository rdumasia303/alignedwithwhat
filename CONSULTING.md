## Services

If you need:
- **Model evaluation** at commercial scale
- **Custom scenario development** for your domain or deployment context
- **Expert analysis** for regulatory compliance, litigation, or internal safety processes
- **Training or workshops** for your team
- **Strategic advisory** on AI alignment testing

That's a conversation I'm happy to have.

## Opportunities

I'm open to discussions about:
- **Commercial engagements** (consulting, advisory, expert witness)
- **Academic collaborations** (research partnerships, co-authorship, visiting positions)
- **Lab collaborations** (if the mission is compelling and the terms are right)
- **Policy work** (advising regulators, standards bodies, government agencies)

The goal is to push the concept forward—whether that's through paid work, research collaboration or whatever depends on the specifics.
